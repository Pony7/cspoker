CSPoker is a lightweight poker client/server written in Java.

The default client runs from the command line. It connects to the game server where the player can join a table, start a game and play countless hours of poker.

The server supports multiple tables where texas hold'em poker can be played. The API is XML based which allows client implementations in any language.
